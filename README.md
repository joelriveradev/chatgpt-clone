# ChatGPTx

ChatGPTx (x for experiment) is a ChatGPT clone built with Remix, Tailwind, Shadcn/UI, and the Vercel AI sdk. It does not replicate every single feature from chatGPT like account management and account plans as they are irrelevant to a protoype, but I did my best to build the core functionality of it. I love the chatGPT UI/UX, and mostly just wanted the satisfaction of building it from scratch to see how it works. I **_may_** build some other features into it that are not currently in the web app like STT/TTS via the whisper api, and file uploads at some time in the future.

**Features:**

- Create and store chats
- Dynamic chat history
- ChatGPT powered chat titles with typewriter effect
- Streamed responses
- Model selection
- Animated prompt suggestions

**Tech Stack:**

- Remix (React)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI
- Shadcn/UI
- Jotai
- Indexed DB
